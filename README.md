# README

Small portoflio of Python projects, mainly in:
- Optimization
- Machine Learning

These projects are related to my industrial PhD supervised by A. Iouditski (Laboratoire Jean Kuntzmann) in collaboration with STMicroelectronics (Crolles, France):
G. Caron, *Statistical learning techniques: application to inverse design and optimization of silicon germanium heterojunction bipolar transistors*, 2024

### Work in Progress

#### 1. Models
Several different Neural Network Models

#### 2. Sensitivity Analysis
Computation of the gradient of outputs w.r.t. inputs, following [1] and some other sensitivity measures inspired by [2].
